## 🌟 What is ReflexCore?

**ReflexCore** is the open-source foundation for Gitswhy OS—a **cognition-native DevSecOps operating system**. It's a lightweight, background-running agent that enhances your shell with real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and secure event logging.

Think of it as your **AI-powered system companion** that runs silently in the background, making your development environment smarter and more responsive.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Cognitive Enhancement**
- **Hesitation Detection**: Automatically detects when you pause while typing.
- **Cognitive Drift Monitoring**: Tracks your workflow patterns.
- **Intent Data Storage**: Securely stores your development intentions.

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization**
- **Smart Overclocking**: Automatically tunes system parameters.
- **Entropy Flushing**: Clears system sludge and caches.
- **Resource Management**: Kills zombie processes and cleans temp files.

### 🔒 **Security & Privacy**
- **Encrypted Vaults**: PBKDF2-encrypted event storage.
- **Secure Logging**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- **Privacy-First**: Runs locally, no data sent to external servers.

### 🛠️ **Developer Experience**
- **Unified CLI**: Manage everything with simple commands.
- **Background Operation**: Zero interference with your workflow.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and macOS.

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### **Step-by-Step Testing Guide**

1. **Initialize the System**
   ```bash
   python3 cli/gitswhy_cli.py init
   ```

2. **Start Core Monitoring**
   ```bash
   python3 cli/gitswhy_cli.py mirror
   ```

3. **Test Keystroke Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Run the monitoring script in background
   modules/gitswhy_coremirror.sh &
   
   # Test by typing with pauses (in the same terminal)
   echo "Type something with a pause..." # Pause 2-3 seconds while typing
   
   # Check logs
   cat ~/.gitswhy/events.log
   ```

4. **Test Performance Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Run GPU overclocking (if supported)
   scripts/gitswhy_gpuoverclock.sh
   
   # Run system cleanup
   scripts/gitswhy_autoclean.sh
   ```

5. **Test Entropy Management**
   ```bash
   # Flush system entropy
   scripts/gitswhy_quantumflush.sh
   ```

6. **Test Vault Operations**
   ```bash
   # Store test data
   python3 gitswhy_vault_manager.py --config config/gitswhy_config.yaml --vault-file ~/.gitswhy/vault.json --operation store --input-file test_data.json
   
   # Retrieve data
   python3 gitswhy_vault_manager.py --config config/gitswhy_config.yaml --vault-file ~/.gitswhy/vault.json --operation retrieve
   ```

7. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   python3 -m pytest testall.py -v
   ```
