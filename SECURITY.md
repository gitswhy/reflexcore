**ReflexCore v1.0.0** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting guidelines.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

ReflexCore is designed with security as a core principle. All sensitive data is encrypted at rest, and the system operates entirely locally without sending data to external servers.

### **Security Features**

- **Local Operation**: All processing happens on your machine
- **Encrypted Storage**: PBKDF2 encryption for vault data
- **No Network Communication**: No data sent to external servers
- **Secure Logging**: Sensitive information is never logged in plain text
- **Permission-Based Access**: Respects system permissions and user privileges

---

## üìã Supported Versions

We release security updates for the latest major version of ReflexCore. Please update to the latest version to receive security patches.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No              |

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest stable release for the best security.
